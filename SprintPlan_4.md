## Sprint retrospection ##

On reflection, 6 weeks was too long to pass without a detailed progress review meting.  Some divergence in expectations and goals seems to have crept in, which in turn probably means we are further behind plan than we shoud be.  I see this as underscoring the need to maintain a continual and regularly reviewed project management focus, especially for a project involving collaboration between non-co-located partners.
