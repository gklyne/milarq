## Improving SPARQL query performance through judicious indexing ##

The MILARQ Project seeks to enhance performance of the CLAROS Explorer VRE, to allow wider public access to a rich set of classical art resources from major European research centres, and incorporation of additional source data.

The software developments relate to Jena, an existing, widely used, open source RDF data management platform. These will include creation of multiple indexes over the underlying RDF triple store, Jena TDB, and other optimizations relating to filter performance.

The developments will be tested and evaluated initially in the context of CLAROS, but it is intended that they will be usable by any system based on the Jena TDB and LARQ RDF storage system.

The project is funded by JISC, and the original project proposal is at http://vreri.googlecode.com/files/Bid30%20MILARQ.pdf.
