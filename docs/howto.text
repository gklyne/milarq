This (draft) document describes how to configure a revised Sparqlite
system to use augmented indexes for faster lookup.

The revised configuration has required extensive changes to the configuration
aspects of Sparqlite -- it is not just a drop-in solution. However the code
is based on sparqlite-20090309-0.4-claros and passes the same tests.
