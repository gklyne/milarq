# Introduction #

The main goals for this sprint are:
  * Prepare the official project plan for JISC
  * Set up project management tools and environment
  * Review the code and prepare an implementation plan
  * Check out the CLAROS test environment

## Current milestone ##

## Implementation plan ##

This activity is deferred to the kick-off meeting with Epimorphics, next sprint.

  * Identify affected system components
  * Sketch changes required
  * Sketch additional test cases

## Test environment ##

  * **Done**: Pull latest CLAROS software
  * **Done**: Ensure all test cases still run
  * Obtain latest partner RDF data
  * Reload data into CLAROS test environment
  * Re-run all test cases

NOTE: see http://code.google.com/p/sparqlite/wiki/SparqliteWithEclipse and other wiuki pages at http://code.google.com/p/sparqlite/ for setup notes.

# Sprint review notes #

Discussion with Epimorphics to take place in the next sprint (15/16 April)

Latest partner data has not been loaded.

Two simple query examples have been identified and documented to focus initial development requirements - the full test suite will still be consulted for review and evaluation of proposed changes.

## End-of-sprint review ##

No formal review meeting.  But see Notes of 15/16 April meeting with Epimorhics (next sprint)
