<h1>indexing for text search in Claros using ARQ and TDB</h1>

<p>
Our base query is (omitting the usual prefixes)
</p>


<div insert="show-test-instance">
  <div arg="label">orig-early-athens-query</div>
</div>

<p>
There are three critical parts of the query, the rest being
scaffolding. They are:

  <ul>
    <li>
        the use of the property function <code>textMatch</code> to find
        literals containing the search term <b>athens</b> and hence those
        subjects mentioning <b>athens</b> in their associated text.
    </li>
    <li>
        the terms around crm:E22.Man-Made_Object identifying the subjects
        as being <b>Pottery</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        the combination of the extraction of the earliest-known date
        <b>?early</b> for the subjects with the ORDER BY/LIMIT 1 clauses
        finding a subject with the earliest earliest-known date.
    </li>
  </ul>

By promoting these critical terms to top level so that the ARQ engine
does not have to explore a deep triple graph, we can reduce this to:

<div insert="show-test-instance">
  <div arg="label">forced-order-textMatch</div>
</div>

The <b>fast:</b> properties are the promoted versions of the embedded
properties in the original query. (Because these integer-valued properties
can be sorted directly by ARQ, we can eliminate the cast to xsd:integer).
</p>

<p>
A significant amount of time is consumed by the ORDER BY part of the
query, as we can see by eliminating it; this shows us how much work 
we can hope to avoid by avoiding an explicit sort, and how much remains
even if we don't use an explicit sort. (The answers are of course wrong.)
</p>

<div insert="show-test-instance">
  <div arg="label">no-order-textMatch</div>
</div>

<p>
Now that the dates are represented as
plain integers, TDB will represent them as inline tagged values, and
they will appear in date order in the TDB indexes.
</p>

<p>
We can exploit this by ensuring that the basic graph pattern that
delivers the bindings for the <b>?early</b> variable comes first.
By a current accident of implementation (which we will enforce by
code changes if necessary), it is sufficient to place the not-before
triple first and remove the ORDER BY:
</p>

<div insert="show-test-instance">
  <div arg="label">athens-by-early-then-textMatch</div>
</div>

<p>
Unfortunately, we have replaced
one timing problem with another one: the <b>textMatch</b>
which generates literals containing "athens" now runs <i>for every
subject with an <b>?early</b> date</i>. 
</p>

<p>
What we really want is to have something -- and by "something", we will
mean a property function -- which delivers in order of earliest date all
and only the subjects matching <b>athens</b> (or whatever the search term 
may be). We can precompute a table which maps the search terms of all the
literals in the data to an ordered list of subjects-by-date: a convenient
representation for experiment is to use the search terms to name files in
a known directory, with each file having "date, subject" lines and
being ordered by date. Our new property function then selects a file
by term and runs through the lines in order.
</p>


<div insert="show-test-instance">
  <div arg="label">composite-adhoc-index</div>
</div>

<p>
We see from the timings that this approach is dramatically faster than
any of the ones that we have tried before, despite its <i>ad-hoc</i>
nature. However, where possible we should use existing technology (ie,
code we don't have to maintain). Lucene can maintain multiple indexes
for is (generally free-text) data because each Lucene document has
multiple indexable fields.
</p>

<p>
We can replace our <i>ad-hoc</i> index by using Lucene and associating
with each document not only its Lucene-derived search term but also
its earliest-known (and, in anticipation, its latest-known) dates.
A Lucene property function can request its index terms be delivered
in order using its <b>Sort</b> objects.
</p>

<div insert="show-test-instance">
  <div arg="label">multiple-lucene-index</div>
</div>

<p>
Sadly, when we try this, the performance is not good, because (as it
turns out) the Lucene sorting is done at run-time, that is, all the
matching (by search term) records are read and then sorted on the
date. This means that it always has to sort all the records, despite
only one being needed -- one of the sources of slowness in our first
example.
</p>

<p>
Our tentative conclusion is that for these purposes the <i>ad-hoc</i>
index is a reasonable solution.
